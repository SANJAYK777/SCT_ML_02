🛍️ Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)
This script performs customer segmentation on the Mall_Customers.csv dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The analysis focuses on two critical features—Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100)—to identify distinct groups of customers. The Elbow Method is implemented to determine the optimal number of clusters, which is found to be K=5. The resulting visualization displays these five segments, with distinct customer profiles ranging from "High Income, Low Spending" to "Low Income, High Spending." This segmentation is essential for targeted marketing strategies.
